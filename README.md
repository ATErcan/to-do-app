# To-Do List

Write your tasks and create a to-do list. Send the less important tasks to do-it later list. Also, list the completed ones in the completed tasks list.

There are 2 counters on the website to show you how many tasks you have to do and how many tasks you have completed so far.

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the layout. 
I used Javascript for the interactivity.
I also used Js DOM.

## Lessons Learned

There is an attribute named data-name. You can use it in many places but in this project it saved me for tracking checkbuttons.

I also learned that we can't give animation to inline elements.

## Appendix

I didn't use localStorage in this project. So, the tasks you wrote will disappear when you refreshed.

I may be make another to-do project with localStorage in sometime later for actual use.
